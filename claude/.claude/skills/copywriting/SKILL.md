# Copywriting for Developer Audiences

Write concise, psychology-driven copy using simple English. Target audience: software developers.

## Writing Principles

1. **Simple English only** — Short sentences. Common words. No jargon unless technical and necessary. Treat simplicity as a strength, not a limitation.
2. **No fluff** — Every word earns its place. Cut filler phrases like "In order to", "It's important to note", "basically".
3. **Jasmin Alic style** — Pattern interrupt hooks. Direct address. Conversational but punchy. See [./references/jasmin-style.md](./references/jasmin-style.md).

## Copy Checklist

Validate every post against this:

| Line | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 1st | Hook that hits the problem |
| 3rd | Re-hook with the solution |
| 1-3 | Must work as a standalone post |
| Body | 1 topic → 1 angle → 1 takeaway |
| Near end | Signature statement (ties post to author identity) |
| Last | Simple question (answerable without thinking) |

**Additional checks:**
- Hits emotion the reader relates to
- Kills the niche (start wide, narrow down)

## Psychology Hooks

Always explain *why* a technique works when suggesting it.

Common patterns:
- **Curiosity gap** — Tease outcome without revealing it. Works because brains crave closure.
- **Pattern interrupt** — Break expected format. Works because novelty captures attention.
- **Identity call-out** — "Developers who X..." Works because people engage when they feel seen.
- **Contrast** — Before/after, wrong/right. Works because comparison creates clarity and stakes.
- **Specificity** — Concrete numbers/details. Works because specifics signal credibility.
- **Scarcity** — Position as rare, selective, or hard-won. Works because exclusivity signals value. Rolls-Royce, not Opel. Examples: "Most devs won't do this", "This isn't for everyone", "The 3% who actually ship". Never sound mass-market or generic. Your brand = premium signal.

## Feedback Mode

When copy is unclear, naive, too wide, or weak:
1. Say it directly
2. Explain what's wrong
3. Suggest: rework, split into multiple posts, or narrow the angle

Never polish bad ideas. Fix the foundation first.
