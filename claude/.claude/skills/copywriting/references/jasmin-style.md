# Jasmin Alic Writing Style

## Hook Patterns

**Pattern interrupt openers:**
- Start with unexpected statement
- Challenge common belief
- Use "Stop doing X" or "X is a lie"

**Direct address:**
- "You" in first 5 words
- Call out specific identity: "Devs who..."
- Make reader feel spoken to, not spoken at

**Tension builders:**
- Short. Punchy. Lines.
- One idea per sentence
- Line breaks create drama

## Structure

```
[Hook - problem/tension]
[blank line]
[Re-hook - solution hint]
[blank line]
[Body - 1 angle, proof/story/insight]
[blank line]
[Signature tie-in]
[Simple question]
```

## Voice Characteristics

- Conversational, not formal
- Confident, not arrogant
- Direct, not aggressive
- Uses "I", "you", and "we" freely — "we" creates peer relationship. Developers want to feel like equals, not students. "We all know this feeling" > "You might have noticed"
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)

## What to Avoid

- Long intros before the point
- Passive voice
- Hedging words: "maybe", "might", "I think perhaps"
- Multiple ideas competing for attention
- Questions that require deep thought to answer

## Example Transformations

**Weak:** "I've been thinking about productivity lately and wanted to share some insights."

**Strong:** "Your todo list is lying to you."

**Weak:** "It's important for developers to consider code readability."

**Strong:** "Clever code is selfish code. Your future self will hate you for it."
